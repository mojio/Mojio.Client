Mojio.Client
============

In order to create our store and apps, we have built a simple C# client library to help us interact with our API. It occurred to us that maybe other people would like to develop in C# as well.  So we have published our Mojio Client on github for anyone to use and play around with!


Installation
============

Using NuGet
-----------

We recommend you use the NuGet package manager to install the **Mojio.Client** NuGet package.

Manually
--------

Download or checkout the Mojio.Client.  You will then need to include the Mojio (Src/Mojio/Mojio.csproj) and Mojio.Client (Src/Mojio.Client/Mojio.Client.csproj) projects into your solution.  Nuget is also required to get our client working, and you will need to perform a Nuget Restore the first time you import the projects.


Getting Started
===============

To begin developing with our client, you will need your very own application ID.  First you will need to create an account and login to our developer center.  We recommend starting with our sandbox environment (https://developer.moj.io/). The enviroment will need to be set when authenticating a user (See **Authenticate a Mojio User** for more details)

Once you have logged in, you can create a new Application.  From here, you will want to copy the Application ID, this will be required to initialize the Mojio.Client. 


Initializing the Client
-----------------------

To get started using the client, you must first create a new instance of the MojioClient object.

```csharp
using Mojio.Client;

String appId = "[YOUR APP ID GOES HERE]";
String redirectUri = "[YOUR REDIRECT URI]";

MojioClient client = new MojioClient(MojioClient.Live);

```

Authenticate a Mojio User
-------------------------

Now that your MojioClient is associated with your app, you can get started making some calls.  However, many of our API calls also require an authorized user to be associated with the client session.  

Mojio now uses OAuth2 for authentication.  In order to authenticate a user, you must navigate to either the Live or Sandbox Mojio authentication server. The default is the Live Server, to connect to the Sandbox server simply specify 'false' for the live parameter of getAuthorizeUri(). 

The redirectUri parameter is an URL where the authentication server will return with an token once the user has logged in.  IMPORTANT: You must register your redirectUri value in your application's management area (http://developer.moj.io/account/apps -> Manage, the redirect URIs field).  The redirect URI that you've set in your app settings and the URI you are using in your source code must match exactly (i.e. exact case) and include the scheme, url, port, and query parameters.  You can list more than one URI in your app settings by putting them on separate lines. 

```csharp
// This will connect to the Sandbox enviroment
Uri loginUri = client.getAuthorizeUri(appId, redirectUri, false);

webBrowser.Navigate(loginUri);
```

From the redirect page, capture the current Uri, parse out the access token and pass it to the Mojio Client. The Token will be set in the Mojio Client so that you can make calls to the API without having to retrieve the token yourself every time. 

```csharp
// On the redirect page 
String currentUrl = HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.AbsoluteUri;

Regex regex = new Regex(@"access_token=([0-9a-f-]{36})");
Match match = regex.Match(currentUrl);
string[] words = match.Value.Split('=');
string code = words[1];

client.TokenAsync(appId, code);
```

Fetching Data
-------------

To retrieve a set of a particular Mojio entities, you can use the "GetAsync" method.  The returned results will depend on what user and application your client session is authorized as. Lists of data will be returned in a paginated form.  You are able to set the page size and request a particular page.  In order to keep response times fast, it is recommended to keep the page size low.

```csharp
// ...
// Set default page size
client.PageSize = 15;
	
// Fetch first page of 15 trips
MojioResponse<Results<Trip>> response = await client.GetAsync<Trip>();
Results<Trip> result = response.Data;
	
// Iterate over each trip
foreach( Trip trip in results.Data )
{
     // Do something with each trip
     // ...
}
```

Fetch a specific Entity
-----------------------

By passing in the ID of an entity (often a GUID), you can fetch just that single entity from the database.

```csharp
// ...
Guid mojioId = new Guid("0a5453a0-7e70-16d1-a2w6-28dl98c10200"); // Mojio ID
	
// Fetch Mojio from API
MojioResponse<Mojio> response = await client.GetAsync<Mojio>(mojioId);
Mojio mojio = response.Data;
	
// Do something with the Mojio data
// ...
```

Update an Entity
----------------

If you want to update and save an entity, you need to first load the entity from the API, make your changes, and then save it back.  Typically only the owner of an entity will be authorized to save changes and not all properties of an entity will be editable (for example, for an App, only the Name and Description properties can be changed).

```csharp
// ...
MojioResponse<App> response = await client.GetAsync<App>(new Guid("015151a1-7e70-16d1-a2w6-28dl98c10200"));
App app = response.Data;

// Make a change
app.Name = "New Name";

// Save the changes
await client.UpdateAsync(mojio);
```

Get a list of child entities
----------------------------

If you want to fetch all the entities associated with another entity, you can call the "GetByAsync" method.  For example, if you want to fetch all the events associated with a Mojio device.

```csharp
// ...
Guid mojioId = new Guid("0a5453a0-7e70-16d1-a2w6-28dl98c10200");

// Fetch all events by Mojio ID
MojioResponse<Results<Event>> response = await client.GetByAsync <Event,Mojio>(mojioId);
Results<Event> events = response.Data;

```

Using the Mojio Storage
-----------------------

With the Mojio API, you are able to store your own private data within our database as key value pairs.  These key value pairs will only be accessible by your application, and you can associate them with any Mojio entities (ex: Mojio Device, Application, User, Trip, Event, Invoice, Product).

```csharp
// ...
Guid userId = new Guid("0a5453a0-7e70-16d1-a2w6-28dl98c10200");  // Some user's ID
string key = "EyeColour";	// Key to store
string value = "Brown"; 	// Value to store

// Save user's eye colour
await client.SetStoredAsync<User>( userId, key , value );
	
// ...
// Retrieve user's eye colour
String stored = await client.GetStoreAsync<User>( userId, key );
```

Using SignalR to listen for events
----------------------------------

Instead of continuously polling the API to see if any new events have come in, our API has a signalR service you can subscribe to in order to be sent new event notifications as they happen.

```csharp
    // ...
    // The Vehicle ID you wish to listen to
    Guid vehicleId = new Guid("0a5453a0-7e70-16d1-a2w6-28dl98c10200");
	
    // An array of event types you wish to be notified about
    EventType[] types = new EventType[] { EventType.IgnitionOn, EventType.LowFuel };

    // Setup the callback function
    public void ReceiveEvent(GuidEntity guidEntity)
    {
    	if(guidEntity.GetType() == typeof(Event))
    	{
    		// ...
    	}
    	else if(guidEntity.GetType() == typeof(Vehicle))
    	{
    		// ...
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		// ...
    	}
    }
    
    var ignitionEvent = new EventObserver(vehicleId, types, ObserverTiming.leading) { Transports = Transport.SignalR });
    
    var observer = await client.CreateAsync(ignitionEvent);
    
    await client.Observe(observer.Id); // Observe the observer
    
    await client.ObserverHandler += ReceiveEvent; // Bind the event listener

    // ...
    // Unsubscribe
    client.Unobserve(observer.Id);
```
